<h1>How To Play</h1>

<h3>Addition</h3>
<p>Addition is a way of combining things and counting them together as one large group. Addition in math is a process of combining two or more numbers. Addends are the numbers added, and the result or the final answer we get after the process is called the sum.Basic addition is the combining of at least two numbers. Students can learn basic addition once they know how to count. They may use an addition chart as a learning tool by finding the addend across the top of the chart and trace down to the row of the second addend.
    the act or process of adding or uniting. the process of uniting two or more numbers into one sum, represented by the symbol +. the result of adding. something added.The concept of addition however is actually fairly straightforward and involves taking two numbers and adding them together to form a total sum. For example – one of the most simple additions is: 2 + 2 = 4.</p>

<h3>Subtraction</h3>
<p>In math, to subtract means to take away from a group or a number of things. When we subtract, the number of things in the group reduces or becomes less. The minuend, subtrahend, and difference are parts of a subtraction problem.Subtraction in mathematics means you are taking something away from a group or number of things. When you subtract, what is left in the group becomes less. An example of a subtraction problem is the following: 5 - 3 = 2.Subtraction of integers can be written as the addition of the opposite number. To subtract two integers, rewrite the subtraction expression as the first number plus the opposite of the second number. Some examples are shown below. To subtract two integers, add the opposite of the second integer to the first integer.</p>

<h3>Multiplication</h3>
<p>In mathematics, multiplication is a method of finding the product of two or more numbers. It is one of the basic arithmetic operations, that we use in everyday life.When we multiply two numbers, the answer is called product. The number of objects in each group is called multiplicand, and the number of such equal groups is called the multiplier. In our case, is the multiplicand, is the multiplier and 6 is the product.Multiplication is when you take one number and add it together a number of times. Example: 5 multiplied by 4 = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20. We took the number 5 and added it together 4 times. This is why multiplication is sometimes called "times".Multiplication (often denoted by the cross symbol ×, by the mid-line dot operator ⋅, by juxtaposition, or, on computers, by an asterisk *) is one of the four elementary mathematical operations of arithmetic, with the other ones being addition, subtraction, and division.</p>

<h3>Division</h3>
<p>What is division in maths? In maths, a division is a process of splitting a specific amount into equal parts. For example, we can divide a group of 20 members into 4 groups of 5 members each or 5 groups of 4 members each, and so on.The meaning of divide is to separate into two or more equal parts, areas, classes, categories, groups or divisions. In simple words, the meaning of divide is to distribute the whole thing to a group in equal parts or make equal parts.This method of distributing a group of things into equal parts is termed as division. It is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic, which gives a fair result of sharing.</p>
